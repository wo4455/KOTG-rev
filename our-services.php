					<h2 class="uppercase"><strong>Speech-Language Therapy</strong></h2>
					<p>Pediatric speech-language therapy services provide therapeutic support for children who are experiencing challenges with communication skills, articulation skills, language acquisition, feeding and swallowing problems, and oral motor strength and coordination.  Speech, language and oral motor skills are integral parts of how your child interacts and communicates with others and how they understand their environment. These skills can also impact the areas of reading and writing. Speech-Language Pathologists address a variety of areas including language comprehension, language expression, auditory processing and listening skills,  speech sound production, phonological development, voice, fluency, social communication, and oral motor skills and feeding skills. 
						<br />
						Our pediatric Speech-Language Pathologists will design a personalized treatment plan to allow your child to achieve their goals and improve the quality of their communication skills as well as improve their ability to chew and swallow foods. This will give your child the best opportunity to reach their fullest potential.

						<h2 class="uppercase"><strong>Feeding Therapy</strong></h2>

						<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold;">What is Feeding Therapy?</span><br />	
						<p>Eating is one of the most important and natural things we do, but also one of the most complex. Feeding Therapy is for children who struggle to eat due to a variety of reasons including picky or selective eating, difficulty managing, chewing or swallowing foods, food allergies, or underlying physiological issues. Our therapists' focus on improving your child's positioning during feeding, oral motor skills (drinking, swallowing, biting, chewing), self- help skills and acceptance of different tastes and textures so that eating is safe, nourishing, and enjoyable for your child. Depending on your child's specific needs, therapy may be lead by an occupational therapist, speech pathologist, or both.</p>
						<span style="font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold;">How do I know when to refer to Feeding Therapy?</span><br />

						<ul>
							<li>mouth non-food items excessively and/or overstuff their mouth?</li>

							<li>cough, choke or gag when eating or drinking?</li>
							<li>have difficulty getting messy?</li>
